Ellie Zolfagharifard . We hardly ever think about it, but the Earth we\\u2019re standing on rotates at around 1,100 miles per hour (1,670 km/h). But what if that rotation suddenly stopped? That's what Michael Stevens, also known as Vsauce on YouTube, set out to answer with his latest video. The London-based scientist has outlined the devastating impact that a sudden halt to the Earth\\u2019s rotation would have on life as we know it. Scroll down for video . Michael Stevens, also known as Vsauce on YouTube, has described what would happen if Earth stopped turning.\\u00a0The gravity of the still Earth is the strongest at the polar regions (shown in green). It is intermediate in the middle latitudes and weakest at the high altitudes of the Andes, close to the equator . Everything would be launched in a ballistic trajectory - around 1,100 mph (1,670 km/h). Those who are somehow able to survive turning into 'supersonic tumbleweed' would have powerful winds to content with, which could destroy everything in their path. Meanwhile, Earth\\u2019s magnetic field would cease to exist and we would be dosed with deadly amounts of ionising radiation. The Earth would become an almost perfect sphere, as the current rotational velocity causes the Earth to bulge out around its equator. On perfect sphere Earth, the world\\u2019s oceans would redistribute, flooding many areas of the planet with a huge volume of water. If the Earth stopped spinning, it would take 365 days for the Sun to move through the sky and return to the same position. If the Earth stopped spinning suddenly, the atmosphere would still be in motion with the Earth's original 1,100 mile per hour (1,670 km/h) rotation speed at the equator. Stevens describes how most people would die a horrific death. \\u2018Immediately everything that wasn\\u2019t on Earth and wasn\\u2019t safely at the poles would continue to moving as it had,\\u2019 he explains. \\u2018It would be flung due east at 1000mph\\u2026Your body would immediately become a 9inch calibre bullet.\\u2019 Those who were somehow able to survive turning into 'supersonic tumbleweed' would have powerful winds to contend with, which could destroy everything in their path. \\u2018Gusts of wind as fast as those near an atomic bomb detonation would blast past the surface and up into the sky forming worldwide storms of unprecedented magnitude,\\u2019 continued Mr Stevens. \\u2018The friction alone, caused by the now stopped Earth colliding with these winds would be enough to cause massive fires and unparalleled erosion\\u2019. Meanwhile, Earth\\u2019s magnetic field would cease to exist and we would be dosed with deadly amounts of ionising radiation. The Earth would become an almost perfect sphere, as the current rotational velocity causes the Earth to bulge out around its equator. Because of the Earth\\u2019s bulge in the middle, the oceans are held out at the equator by 5 miles (8 km). On a perfect sphere Earth, the world\\u2019s oceans would redistribute, flooding many areas of the planet with a huge volume of water. Those who are somehow able to survive turning into 'supersonic tumbleweed' would have powerful winds to contend with, which could destroy everything in their path. \\u2018Gusts of wind as fast as those near an atomic bomb detonation would blast past the surface,\\u2019 explained Stevens . If the Earth\\u2019s rotation slowed to one every 365 days, a condition called 'sun synchronous', every spot in the Earth would have permanent daytime or night-time all year long. This is similar to the situation on the moon where for two weeks the front-side is illuminated by the sun, and for two weeks the back side is illuminated. If it stopped spinning completely, the world would have half a year daylight, and half a year night time. \\u2018The yearly change in the sun's position in the sky would now be just its seasonal motion up and down the sky towards the south due to the orbit of the Earth and its axial tilt,\\u2019 Nasa said. \\u2018As you moved along constant lines of Earth latitude, you would see the elevation of the sun increase or decrease in the sky just as we now see the elevation of the sun change from a single point on the Earth due to the Earth's daily rotation.\\u2019 But while this may sound horrific, according to Nasa, the probability for such an event is \\u2018practically zero\\u2019 in the next few billion years.

'Although our family are still deeply shocked and grieving for Anne, we are pleased to say that both Anne's mother and son are recovering from their injuries and have both been given wonderful care, treatment and support by hospital and consulate staff and many other local people. 'It appears that the person that Anne employed as a general gardener/handyman, to look after her holiday villas, has committed this terrible crime. 'We cannot comprehend the mentality of somebody who would do this to three lovely people who would never harm anybody. 'We would like once again to thank everyone for their kindness and offers of help - they are a great source of strength to us. 'We are sure that you will understand that we would now like peace and privacy at this time so that we can get on with everything we need to do.' Earlier today, Anne's son Alex Bury, 24,\\u00a0 said he tried to reason with alleged attacker, Veli Acar, before he opened fire on Miss Bury, 56. Speaking from his bed in Mugla University Hospital, Mr Bury, 24, said he recognised the gunman as Acar, their gardener, who was said to have been in a relationship with Miss Bury. He claimed Acar had threatened the family earlier that weekend but was later released by police and returned, armed, to the Bury villa in the resort of Dalyan at around 5am on Monday.

The shootings happened in the early hours of Monday, after a party to mark Miss Bury\\u2019s birthday. The . 46-year-old gunman, named by locals as Turkish gardener and handyman . Velli Acar, appears to have targeted the family in some kind of revenge . attack. He blasted Mrs Bury . in the back and shot her grandson in the leg. Miss Bury fled in\\u00a0 terror . up three flights of stairs and bolted herself in her bathroom. But Acar . blasted the lock and reportedly shot her four times at point-blank range . as she cowered on the tiled floor. She died at the scene. Her son and widowed mother were taken by ambulance to separate hospitals. Mrs . Bury was later discharged and Alex was said to be in a \\u2018stable\\u2019 condition after undergoing successful surgery to repair a damaged artery . in his leg. Locals . in Dalyan claimed that Miss Bury may have been in a relationship with . Acar and the killing was probably a crime of passion. Neighbour Ozman Tugcu said: \\u2018I\\u2019d seen . them out together occasionally and thought they were a couple. But they . were both quiet and kept themselves to themselves.\\u2019 But . another neighbour said the row was over money, and Acar had been . accused of pocketing cash intended for other tradesmen for work at the . villa. Police have refused to comment on the motive for the shooting. Mr . Tugcu described the British family as \\u2018quiet and respectable people\\u2019. He said he was alerted to the shooting by the arrival of police. Alex Bury planned to become a doctor, according the family's neighbours in north Allerton . \\u2018I . was horrified to see the elderly lady brought out of the house,\\u2019 he . said. \\u2018She was covered in blood. I was sure she was dead and am . astonished she survived. It\\u2019s a really dreadful thing to happen.\\u2019 The gunman later gave himself up to police and was remanded in\\u00a0 custody yesterday ahead of a formal court appearance. Miss Bury and her family had been going to stay in their villa in the tiny fishing village for six years. Acar, . described as a heavy drinker, had been reported to police over alleged . death threats and was arrested on Saturday. He was held overnight for . questioning and released the following day. Locals said the suspect also owned a boat and ran trips for tourists in the resort. One . resident said he would regularly drink a bottle of a strong local wine. \\u2018Veli was a quiet man but we think he had an alcohol problem,\\u2019 he . said. The Bury family had\\u00a0 decorated their villa with bunting and . balloons for the birthday party by the pool on Sunday. Yesterday blood smears could be seen on the marble floors beneath the decorations. Friends and neighbours at home in Britain paid tribute to the dead woman and expressed their shock. Miss Bury, a former nurse from North Yorkshire, worked as a risk manager for a Saudi-based medical services company. Neighbour Stephen Garbut said the family are 'the nicest people you could ever wish to meet'. Pictured is the Bury family's UK home in Northallerton, North Yorkshire . She had a masters degree in law and a degree in midwifery. Mr Bury, her only child, had graduated from university and was working in medical research while planning to train as a doctor. Miss . Bury lived in a bungalow in Swainby, North Yorkshire, but spent . prolonged periods abroad working in Saudi Arabia and visiting her . holiday home in Turkey. Neighbour Steve Garbutt, 72, said: \\u2018They were a . lovely family and this has come as a terrible shock. \\u2018You . just don\\u2019t expect anything like this to happen. [She] was an excellent . neighbour and was always friendly when you spoke to her. Officers cordon off the scene. Birthday decorations can be seen adorning the porch . Neighbours said the suspect, Velli Acar, was a quiet man who used to run boat trips for tourists . Investigation: A jandarma officer takes pictures at the villa . \\u2018I . never ever heard a bad word, or a cross word or anything like that from . any of them.

a position that seems likely to be filled by former manchester united assistant phil neville - partly because he was keen to be closer to his family in dundee, but also because he was eager to become a manager in his own right. indeed, he was only dissuaded from doing so a year previously when head coach nuno espirito santo asked his assistant to join him in making the move from portuguese top flight side rio ave to valencia. but cathro, who held talks with rangers before the appointment of mark warburton as the ibrox club manager, refused to entertain suggestions that accepting a role on the newcastle staff was at odds with his stated ambitions. i wanted a fresh challenge and didn't want to just sit it out over there and wait for the right manager job to come up, he said. to come into british football as a manager with no experience of working with english-speaking players is perhaps not advisable anyway so this makes perfect sense. ill-feeling and despair enveloped st james' park last season, with fans angered by an apparent lack of interest and ambition on the part of owner mike ashley. however, ashley assurances over his commitment, promise of more investment and the appointment of mcclaren have lifted spirits and convinced cathro of the club potential. steve coming in has brought a freshness and enthusiasm to get the club back to where it should be and serve the love that exists for it, cathro added. i'm convinced that it a club willing to grow and would be comfortable higher in the league. it now ready to do that. a parallel could be drawn with the valencia that cathro discovered upon his arrival. the club were in flux off the pitch and floundering on it, having failed to qualify for european football the previous season. by the time he left 12 months later, the mestalla outfit were in the champions league qualifying round. it is a lot to leave behind, but cathro has no regrets. i'm completely comfortable with it, he said. i'm going to watch valencia in the champions league and in la liga and enjoy them playing in wonderful games in great stadiums. but i've no fear of missing out because the intention is to go to that level again. if that was with newcastle, that would be perfect, but if not i'll certainly be back working abroad in the next five to 10 years. such confidence was partly what attracted rangers to cathro during their search for a new manager. it had been suggested that his decision to leave spain was informed by that interest but the former dundee united youth coach is adamant that the initial contact and two informal meetings with ibrox directors paul murray and john gilligan only came after he had decided to return to scotland. i was interested in the uniqueness of the challenge, he said. and it would be foolish not to talk to them, but it may not have been the correct conditions for me to begin as a manager and perhaps they adopted a similar view. it was a positive experience and i'd wish them well because they demonstrated that they were keen to really look at what caused the issues on the football side in the past and build something different.\",\n          \"the ecuadorian international, 25, limped off during the swans' 1-0 victory over aston villa on boxing day. montero left the field in tears and is set to miss at least four league games, including monday trip to liverpool. it not as bad as we thought it would be, which is good news, said manager garry monk. jefferson all season has been very good for us so he will be a miss, but it a chance for other people. montero departed the field after 21 minutes against villa, after winning the free-kick which gylfi sigurdsson scored from. it was swansea second successive league win, following on from a 1-0 win at hull city, to leave monk side in eighth place in the premier league ahead of the trip to anfield.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"dp world tour championship is taking place this week in dubai . rory mcilroy teed off in the final group with henrik stenson . mcilroy has won the race to dubai title for second time in three years .\",\n          \"ian cathro will be confirmed as steve mcclaren assistant at newcastle within the next 48 hours.\",\n          \"swansea city winger jefferson montero has been ruled out for around a month with a hamstring strain.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Dataset\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"XSum\",\n          \"CNN/Daily Mail\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "\"Ashton Kutcher has entered the firestorm surrounding under-fire taxi-hiring app Uber and defended controversial comments made by an executive who\\xa0suggested spending $1 million to dig up dirt on journalists who criticize the company. Kutcher, an investor in the app, took to Twitter on Wednesday to show his support for beleaguered VP Emil Michael and described Sarah Lacy, a female journalist who has been highly critical of the company, as 'shady'. 'What is so wrong about digging up dirt on shady journalist?' tweeted the celebrity tech entrepreneur who has invested in tech firms including Skype, Foursquare, Airbnb and Spotify through his\\xa0venture capital firm A-Grade. Under-fire: Ashton Kutcher has entered the firestorm surrounding taxi-hiring app Uber and defended Senior VP Emil Michael who suggested spending $1 million to dig up dirt on journalists who criticize the company . Outburst: Kutcher, an investor in the app, took to Twitter on Wednesday to attack Sarah Lacy, the journalist who has criticized the company . 'So as long as journalist are interested and willing to print half truths as facts... Yes we should question the source' he continued in a series of tweets before he sought to clarify that he was speaking for himself and not Uber. 'This should be fun... Here comes the part where journalist explain why they should be exempt from ridicule and judgement and probing...' he continued. The actor's attempt to defend Uber quickly provoked a negative reaction from many Twitter users who accused him of only getting involved because he was an investor in the company and of unfairly describing Lacy as shady for reporting facts about the service. 'A journalist harassed by a company you invested in. Nice' tweeted @tiedtiger. 'What makes her shady?' wrote @KeenPOV. 'Pointing out how some Uber drivers are sexual assailants?' Not long after Kutcher decided it might be best just to apologize. 'U r all right and I'm on the wrong side of this ultimately. I just wish journalists were held to the same standards as public figures,' he tweeted. Target: Kutcher was speaking with specific reference to Sarah Lacy (left), editor of PandoDaily, who recently wrote about deleting her Uber app (right) after the firm teamed up with an apparent escort service in France . Kutcher's attempt to defend Uber provoked a negative reaction from many Twitter users who accused him of only getting involved because he was an investor in the company . In 2011, Kutcher was forced into an embarrassing climbdown after tweeting that the sacking of Joe Paterno as head coach of Penn State showed 'no class' and was an 'insult' to his legacy. Many people labelled Kutcher an idiot for his view and after a barrage of complaints he deleted his tweet and recanted his stance. 'This is an insane story, I just heard paterno was fired, getting the rest of the story now... Wow,' he wrote. He added: 'Heard Joe was fired, fully recant previous tweet! Didn't have full story. #admitwhenYoumakemistakes' Kutcher's Uber comment come a day after Emil Michael was forced to make a grovelling apology over his controversial comments. The senior vice president was speaking at a private dinner in Manhattan on Friday, when he said that he had dreamed up an eight-man team who would find out about writers' personal lives and families so that Uber could discredit them. The sinister scheme - which was targeted at a Silicon Valley editor who has savaged the company for its alleged 'sexism and misogyny' - drew an outraged backlash when it became public. Tweets: Kutcher made a series of tweets on Wednesday in which was critical of journalist Sarah Lacy  before seeking to clarify that he was speaking for himself and not Uber . A chorus of disapproval aimed at Michael prompted a humiliating public apology to Sarah Lacy, the editor of PandoDaily, in which he disowned the idea entirely. Michael posted an apology to Lacy's Twitter account, saying: 'I would like to apologize to you directly. My comments were wrong and I deeply regret them. 'Neither me [sic] nor my company would ever engage in such activities. Again, I apologize.' The remarks will do little to improve Uber's fragile relationship with the media following the portrayal of its management team as insensitive and aggressive toward customer complaints. And, indeed, the apology did not stop Lacy from writing a scathing opinion piece\\xa0on PandoDaily, in which she said the plan was 'like a five-year-old pretending to be Frank Underwood' - a reference to Kevin Spacey's scheming politician character in Netflix series House of Cards. According to Lacy, Michael also called her cell phone and ask to speak in private, but hung up after she refused to have an off-the-record conversation. The dinner party in question was hosted by Ian Osborne, ex-adviser to British Prime Minister David Cameron and consultant for Uber . Michael's plan came up when he was asked about the firm's negative press coverage. Venue: During the dinner party at Manhattan's Waverly Inn (pictured), Michael was reportedly asked about the firm's depictions in the press and responded that Uber should consider hiring researchers to snoop on writers . In response, the executive suggested that Uber should consider spending 'a million dollars' of its reported $15 billion worth on hiring four researchers and four journalists, according to BuzzFeed. The eight-strong hit team would investigate 'your personal lives, your families' with a view to discrediting journalists behind\\xa0unfavorable\\xa0reports on the taxi service, he said. Michael was especially focused on Lacy, who also recently accused Uber of 'sexism and misogyny' on her Silicon Valley website, writing: 'The company simply doesn’t respect us or prioritize our safety.' He reportedly expressed anger over her claims that, responding that women are far more likely to suffer assault at the hands of normal taxi drivers than Uber drivers. He said Lacy should be held 'personally responsible' for any women who copy her and delete the taxi app, and are then sexually assaulted, it is reported . Apology: Michael, who used to work at Klout and also sits on a board advising the Department of Defense, later took to Twitter to apologize for his comments to Lacy herself, saying: 'I would like to apologize to you directly' Contradicting his remarks: He added: 'Neither me nor my company would ever engage in such activities' And in reference to a specific claim about Lacy's personal life, he said Uber's dirt-diggers could work covertly to expose and discredit her to others, adding: 'Nobody would know it was us.' After being confronted about his comments, Michael, who has been at Uber for more than a year and was previously described as a 'top deal guy' by founder Travis Kalanick, later apologized. In a statement to BuzzFeed on Monday evening, he said he believed he was speaking off the record and that\\xa0his remarks did not reflect his or Uber's views. 'The remarks attributed to me at a private dinner - borne out of frustration during an informal debate over what I feel is sensationalistic media coverage of the company I am proud to work for - do not reflect my actual views and have no relation to the company’s views or approach,' he said. 'They were wrong no matter the circumstance and I regret them.' At no point during the dinner did Michael suggest the firm has already hired opposition researchers. An Uber spokesman confirmed that the company does not carry out such research and has never considered doing it because it would be a 'clear violation of our privacy and data access policies'. The event at Waverly Inn on Friday evening was attended by a number of high-profile figures, including\\xa0actor Ed Norton\\xa0and publisher Arianna Huffington.

        "Overview: BART is a transformer model developed by Facebook AI that combines bidirectional and auto-regressive elements. It is designed for tasks that involve sequence generation, such as text summarization, machine translation, and text generation. BART can be thought of as a generalization of both BERT (which is bidirectional) and GPT (which is auto-regressive).\n",
        "\n",
        "Architecture: BART is essentially an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder is similar to BERT and the decoder is similar to GPT. The encoder takes the input text, processes it bidirectionally, and then the decoder generates the output text auto-regressively (predicting each word one at a time).\n",
        "\n",
        "### DistilBART\n",
        "\n",
        "Overview: DistilBART is a distilled version of BART. Distillation is a process where a smaller model (the \"student\") is trained to mimic the behavior of a larger model (the \"teacher\"), resulting in a model that is faster and lighter while retaining much of the performance of the original model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Efficiency: The primary goal of DistilBART is to provide a more efficient alternative to BART. It is typically smaller, faster, and requires less computational resources, making it suitable for deployment in environments with limited resources, such as mobile devices or real-time applications."

        "\n",
        "Variants:\n",
        "\n",
        "- ROUGE-1: Measures the overlap of unigrams (single words). It evaluates the ability of the model to capture the content in individual words.\n",
        "- ROUGE-2: Measures the overlap of bigrams (two consecutive words). This captures the ability of the model to maintain the sequence of words.\n",
        "- ROUGE-3, ROUGE-4, etc.: Measure overlap of trigrams, four-grams, and so on. Higher n-grams capture more context but can be harder to match exactly.\n",
        "- Interpretation: Higher ROUGE-N scores indicate better preservation of the original content and structure in the generated text.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. ROUGE-L\n",
        "- Definition: ROUGE-L measures the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the generated and reference summaries. The LCS is a sequence that appears in both texts in the same order but not necessarily consecutively.\n",
        "- Why LCS?: Unlike n-gram overlap, LCS takes into account sentence-level word order and is less strict about consecutive matching, making it more adaptable to different writing styles.\n",
        "- ROUGE-LSum is a variant of the ROUGE-L metric, specifically designed for evaluating the quality of summarization tasks where multiple sentences are involved. It extends the original ROUGE-L by focusing on the sequence of sentences in addition to the sequence of words within those sentences."
